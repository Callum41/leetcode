Well, I tried the dayly challenge after beating the third exercise.
 Starting with Python, I overcame the challenge, but discovered
 it wasn't as fast as it needed to be in order to pass all the tests on time, 
 so I moved on to Java which seemed to work faster. Still though, my solution did better
 but wasn't able to pass all the tests on time as well, so I had to tell ChatGPT to
 improve it for me, as I didn't know how could I. Now that's another thing to work on
 from now on, efficiency on algorithms.
