Well, this time around my own algorithm also didn't pass the tests on time, 
mostly because it was more time consuming that the solution chatgpt gave me.
I can't really do much about that, only learn about orders of algorithms, 
but I don't know yet how to propperly refine the code in an efficient way as 
I don't know all the libraries and functions available to do so.
